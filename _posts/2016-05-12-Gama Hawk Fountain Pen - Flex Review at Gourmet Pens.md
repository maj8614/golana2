# [Gama Hawk Fountain Pen - Flex Review at Gourmet Pens](http://www.gourmetpens.com/2016/05/review-gama-hawk-fountain-pen-flex.html)  

Azizah Asgarali at Gourmet Pens reviews the Gama Hawk Fountain Pen  

>  I love the ebonite feed, and the smell of the ebonite itself. It's a nice, relatively affordable way to dabble with flex pens, and to use any sort of fountain pen inks, even those hard to clean ones. It also doesn't fit in most of my pen cases, so I have to keep it around my desk area if I want to use it.  

It certainly looks unique. I wonder how feels in hand.
